This project was completed as part of Codecademy's Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages Path. As part of the Git and Publishing to Github Pages tutorial we were required to learn how to use the Git version control system to keep track of changes and publish our website to GitHub Pages. In order to replicate a landing page to advertise a mobile app for a product called “Excursion,” we were provided a design mock and redline mock, along with the supporting video, image, and icon resources. We then utilized the command line interface to create our project's folder structure and initialize a Git repository. Throughout the process of creating the site we learned how to add files to Git's staging area, commit and push changes, and finally deploy the site after setting up GitHub Pages.
